# cursor_control_using_hand_and_face_gesture
A computer vision-based system that enables mouse control using hand and head gestures via webcam. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it allows real-time gesture recognition for cursor movement and clicks. Ideal for accessibility, hands-free control, and experimental human-computer interaction.

📌 Features
🎯 Real-time hand and head gesture detection

🖱️ Cursor movement using hand position

🖐️ Click and drag operations via custom gestures

👤 Head movement tracking for additional control

⚡ Works with standard webcams

🧠 Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV – video processing

MediaPipe – hand and face landmark detection

PyAutoGUI – cursor and click automation

Dlib / FaceMesh (optional) – head gesture enhancement

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above

Webcam (built-in or external)


Installation
git clone https://github.com/adnanfuzail/cursor_control_using_hand_and_head_gesture.git
cd cursor_control_using_hand_and_head_gesture


📷 How It Works
Captures live webcam feed

Detects hand and head landmarks using MediaPipe

Translates gestures into mouse movements or clicks

Sends commands using PyAutoGUI

🎯 Use Cases
Accessibility for users with mobility impairments

Hands-free computing in sterile environments

Gesture-based HCI research

AR/VR prototype interfaces

📖 Future Improvements
Add gesture customization

Improve gesture accuracy

Integrate voice control

Support multi-monitor setups
